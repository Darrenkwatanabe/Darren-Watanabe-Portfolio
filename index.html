            <p> Hi, my name is Darren Watanabe and I am a full stack web developer in the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. <br>
                I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science. Ever since being exposed to this type of work, I've <br>
                wanted to learn more and felt this was a great opportunity. Besides taking this bootcamp, my hobbies include <br>
                playing sports, working out, and just having a great time with family and friends.
            </p>
