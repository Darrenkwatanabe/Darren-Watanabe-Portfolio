## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://darrenkwatanabe.github.io/Darren-Watanabe-Portfolio/)

In this project, we were assigned to create our professional portfolio to showcase our work, as well providing some background information about us with our contact information. 
While writing out the code for this project, we were to display our knowledge of the material we've learned so far:

1. Utilizing semantic elements in the HTML and CSS to make our code more organized and accesible
2. Incorporating id classes to link keywords to a desired part of the webpage
3. Utilizing the flexbox grid as a way to display content on a page
4. Adding media queries to allow the webpage to adapt as the screen size changes
