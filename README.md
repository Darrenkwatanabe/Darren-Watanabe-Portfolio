In this project, we were assigned to create our professional portfolio to showcase our work, as well providing some background information about us with our contact information. 
While writing out the code for this project, we were to display our knowledge of the material we've learned so far:

1. Utilizing semantic elements in the HTML and CSS to make our code more organized and accesible
2. Incorporating id classes to link keywords to a desired part of the webpage
3. Utilizing the flexbox grid as a way to display content on a page
4. Adding media queries to allow the webpage to adapt as the screen size changes

This project helps us for our future in showcasing our work in hopes of getting hired. We can continue to add any desired projects we would like to display to only help improve the appearance of my portfolio.
